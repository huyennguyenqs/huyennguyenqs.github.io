        <p>The world of finance today looks quite different from the world of Mr. Potter’s era. The core institutions remain intact, but the advent of new technologies has produced a financial world in which transactions occur in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p><strong>THE SELL SIDE OF FINANCE</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The earlier distinctions between commercial banking and investment 
banking are no longer as defined as they once were. 
The most important lesson in studying the modern financial services
industry is that the sector lines are blurred.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Commercial Banking</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Commercial banks make their money by securing deposits and lending
the money. As long as the rate of interest paid to depositors is 
lower than the rate of interest charged to the borrowers, the bank
makes money. The lifeblood of the commercial banking industry in the
US is the federal funds rate. This is the rate at which banks and
credit unions lend money overnight to other banks. The rate is
determined by the Federal Reserve Bank’s Federal Open Market Committee,
which meets 8 times per year and sets this rate. The banks are able to
borrow at this rate and, in turn, lend to consumers and businesses at
a higher rate. 

Commercial banks charge all kinds of fees: ATM fees, account maintenance
fees, and application fees. And don’t forget the penalties.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Investment Banking</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>One of the primary functions of the investment bank is to offer underwriting
services to its clients. The best part about all of this is that the
investment bankers will make a hefty commission on the transaction.

Bankers often advise clients on buying and selling companies. Whether the
banker values a company for sale or for purchase, valuation will form the
cornerstone of the transaction.

Traders will buy and sell securities in blocks and earn commissions on each
trade. Since the traders are dealing with large allocations of securities,
they will rely on salespeople to pitch the trade idea to large institutions.
The trader can add value by finding the best price, which often entails
parceling out individual blocks of the trade or dividing it into smaller
portions. So many large investment banks have sales and trading groups.

One of the most powerful influences in the world of finance is equity research.
Equity research analysts will research entire industries as well as individual
companies that form these industries. The goal of the research analyst is to
provide value-added market insights that allow customers who subscribe to the
research to make smart investment decisions.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Retail Brokerage</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>One of the oldest businesses in the finance world. Retail brokers, or stockbrokers,
are the good folks who bring Wall Street to Main Street. Brokerage fees dropped
and new technology all but eliminated the need for human resources in the world
of stock purchases.
</code></pre></div></div>
