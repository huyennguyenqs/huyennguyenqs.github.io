Business Requirements identify very high level business needs to fix issues and support business opportunities. These are normally defined by executives and senior people in the organization and key decision makers. Business reqs are commonly expressed in terms of measurable objectives and outcomes.

- Specific: this means the requirement wording is clear, concise, and unambiguous.
- Measurable: this means the requirement has a criteria which can be tested.
- Achievable: this means the requirement can be successfully attained given project environment.
- Realistic: this means the requirement can be associated with a stakeholder, process, or system, function, model, design element; or test document.

To deliver the stakeholder requirement weâ€™ll need to detail the solution requirements, and these are split into functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements.
