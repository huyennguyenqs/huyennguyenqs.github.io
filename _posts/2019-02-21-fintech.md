Fintech or financial technology is often misunderstood as a disruption technology, instead of referring to as <em>integration technology</em>.

In most cases, fintech solutions integrate existing systems (both hardware & software). From the perspective of fintech developers, the challenge is integrating new software with the old and existing systems. From the perspective of financial services institutions, the challenge is providing operating platforms that are friendly to developers.

Within the financial services sector, fintech can reduce complexity and minimize friction in data-intensive areas such as personal finance, loan origination, cash transfer, consumer banking, capital markets, and equities trading.

>“Fintech isn’t just for bankers, brokers, and hedge fund managers. It’s also for merchants and shopkeepers. And increasingly, fintech is for consumers,” says Michael Minelli, Vice President of Commercialization at Mastercard Labs.
