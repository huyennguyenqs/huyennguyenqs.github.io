Business Analysts lead efforts to define needs and design solutions that deliver value to stakeholder organizations. The complex role utilizes business strategy, operational processes and procedures, requirements management, and subject matter expertise to lead organizations through complex changes. They manage stakeholder expectations, focus on requirements and solutions, measure performance, and, when necessary, suggest and implement corrective actions.
